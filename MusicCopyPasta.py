This song is the feeling of falling asleep on a long car ride passing by a distant city,
the feeling of waking up so early on a winter morning that its still dark and falling
right back into sweet slumber, the feeling of going on midnight bus rides alone to
absolutely nowhere and watching lights and street signs flash by, the feeling of being
so tired your eyes wont stay open and every sound blends together into a perfect harmony
as you fall asleep, the feeling of faint deja vu listening to old 80's music, the feeling
of that melancholic nostalgia when you visit an old place. I'd like to imagine this song
to be the feeling an astronaut feels, looking back at the earth from far away, looking
back at the place youve been your whole life, where all your friends and memories are,
where all your greatest achievements took place, where your tiny life started and where
it will inevitably end, the feeling of true peace, knowing that everything youve ever
known is so miniscule to the scale of everything, truly being alone with your thoughts,
processing the utterly unbelievable one of a kind, oddly lonely but soothing feeling.
This song is truly an amazing feeling.
